## About this App:
+ A video player app that shows a variety of youtube videos that users can vote/rank. The app will display the videos dynamically based on the rankings of the users. Our main page will be a list of music videos,  but the user will have an option to sort/filter the videos based on various rankings and/or categories. 

## Technologies:
- React (React Hooks, React Router, React Player)
- Node (Express, Mongoose)
- MongoDB
- Heroku and Git/GitHub for deployment and organization
- Slack and Zoom for team communication

## Known Bugs/Future Goals:
- Other filtering features like sorting votes from low to high
- Combining Create and Edit components
- Anticipating large amounts of data in the database by only loading 10 results per page or loading by scroll distance
- merging user auth work into master, and adding features such as comments and seeing which videos a user has voted on

## MVP
- As a user I would like to have the videos displayed on the main page.
- As a user I would like to be able to cast my vote or ranking on each of the videos.
- As a user I want to be able to sort/filter the videos according to preference.
- As a user I would like to be able to play the videos.
- As a user I would like to be able to share videos I see on the site to my friends.
- As a user I would like to be able to have a reactive and easy navigation tool on the site.
- As a user I would like to have a clean/nice user experience that looks aesthetically pleasing.
- As a user I would like to have a separate page/component to play each video on it’s own.
- As a user I would like to have a search functionality to find videos I like.

## Stretch

- As a user I would like to be able to have my own profile and login to keep my collection and “liked” videos.
- As a user I would like to be able to save the videos I like to my own personal collection.
- As a user I would like to be able to comment on the videos to discuss rankings.
- As a user I would like to have the video input limited and/or restricted to certain content.
